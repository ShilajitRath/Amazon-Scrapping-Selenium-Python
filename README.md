## Web scraping

The internet has a staggering amount of data that can be used for businesses or for personal purposes. To gain some understanding and conduct worthwhile research, we need data. Finding trends, patterns, or insightful information from a vast amount of data by simply browsing the internet is not feasible and is not worth your time. 
The most valuable resource that we can rely on when making critical decisions for our businesses or personal lives is data. 

## Why we should use the data present on internet?

Here I've provided some real-world examples of why we need data on the internet. 
1. Day-to-day use case
    * In today's digital age, we mostly shop online. And in order to buy something, we must always scroll through numerous websites and pages, paying close attention to the price, quality, and dependability of the product that we wish to purchase.
    * For example, we want to see a movie. We scroll through online websites like Amazon, checking the price and reviews of each movie, but we still don't know whether it's good or not. What others say after watching it. We try to read each review, which can be time-consuming, but we're not sure if we're watching the right movie reviews because there are so many movies available on the internet. 

2. Organizational Use Cases
   * Collect and analyze online data for decision-making and identifying market trends and patterns. Customers provide feedback on products, and so on.
    
## How to collect the data from internet 
* We can use webscraping technique to collect data from internet. 

There are enough amount of packages in python to do web scraping such as:
1. Beautiful Soup
2. Mechanical Soup
3. Selenium
4. Scrapy 

Also we can collect the data via APIs. Because in some cases you need to find some hidden APIs to request the data from the  website. 

Here I have used Selenium to scrape data about movies and films from amazon website. 

What you need to scrape the data from amazon. 

1. Python IDE: To write an efficient code
2. Selenium: Python package which is used to scape the data faster. 
3. Web driver: web driver is a tool to open the browser we chose (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari). Whatever browser you want to use, the driver should be compatible with your browser version and your operating system.

To see how I did the scraping. all the code open the Scraper.ipynb file. 

Analyse those data and find some insights and use cases. 

I have intended to find movies and films on amazon and most popular movies.  

#### I choose to scrape informations below
